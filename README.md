# microBean Helidon `JerseySupport` CDI

This project consists of a CDI 2.0 portable extension that ensures
that Helidon's `JerseySupport` class is registered as the sole
`Service` in an embedded Helidon `WebServer` that runs inside the CDI
2.0 container.

For more background on this sort of thing, you might want to see the
